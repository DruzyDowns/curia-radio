      In Australia, the Avensis Verso was available from 2001 to 2010 and was
      back-to-back winner of Australia's Best People Mover award in 2002 and
      2003.[2] There were two models, the 2001–2003 ACM20R and the 2003–2010
      ACM21R and both came in two trim levels, the base GLX and the Ultima with
      upgraded interior trim and roof rails. The ACM20R model came in 3 variants
      with all having the 2.0 L 1AZ-FE engine. The GLX was available with either
      a 4-speed automatic or a 5-speed manual transmission while the Ultima was
      only available with the 4-speed automatic.[3] The 2004 model ACM21R
      arrived with a minor facelift and an upgraded 2.4 L 2AZ-FE engine. Both
      the GLX and Ultima variants were now only available with the 4-speed
      automatic. The entire model line was discontinued in late 2010.
