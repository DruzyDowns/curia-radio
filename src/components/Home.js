      multi-purpose vehicle produced by the Japanese automaker Toyota from 1995
      to 2009. The Ipsum, like many Toyota products, was shared as a trio of the
      Toyota Gaia, and sold only at Japanese Toyota dealerships called Toyota
      Store, next to the Toyota Carina. The Gaia was unique to Toyopet Store
      locations, and the Toyota Nadia was sold at Toyota Corolla Store. First
      generation (XM10; 1995–2001) The first generation, named Ipsum in Japan
      and Picnic in export markets, was built from 1995–2001, with export
      versions arriving in 1996. A commercial version was sold as the Toyota

      ranging from 1.8- to 2.0-litres, as well as a 2.2-litre diesel engine, the
